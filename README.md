## Description

This is the first assignment of the [IFT6135: Representation-Learning](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/ift6135), taught by Prof. [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/).

## Theory

Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural networks: [Statement and Solution](https://github.com/Sanaelotfi/IFT-6135-Representation-Learning-HW1/blob/master/IFT6135_HW1_Theory.pdf).


## Practice

[Statement](https://github.com/Sanaelotfi/Representation-Learning-HW1/blob/master/HW1_practice_statement.pdf).

This is a joint work with Abderrahim Khalifa, Yann Bouteiller and Amine Bellahsen. 

### Problem 1: building a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and training it on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

[Solution](https://github.com/Sanaelotfi/IFT-6135-Representation-Learning-HW1/blob/master/Problem1.ipynb).

Best model validation accuracy:  98.41%. 

### Problem 2: training a convolutional network on MNIST

[Solution](https://github.com/Sanaelotfi/IFT-6135-Representation-Learning-HW1/blob/master/Problem2.ipynb).

Obtained test accuracy: 99.14 %.

### Problem 3: Dogs vs. Cats InclassKaggle challenge for image classification.

[Solution](https://github.com/Sanaelotfi/IFT-6135-Representation-Learning-HW1/blob/master/Problem3.ipynb).
You can use the to_npy.py file to generate the data.npz file from raw images.

Best validation accuracy: 89%.
